Welcome to snake!
Snake is a classic arcade game. 
You will play as a hungry, growing snake. 
Navigate through the map using the arrow keys, eating cherries. 
Every time the snake eats a cherry, it grows in length. 
If the snake runs into a wall or itself...GAME OVER. 
Get as many points as possible before dying.
Choose your difficulty and game mode to play.

Arcade mode:
Bombs will start to spawn...They are dangerous if eaten!!!
Every 7 cherries, a golden cherry will spawn. 
Eat this and all bombs can't hurt you.
In fact, they will you give you points and length. 
You also CANNOT eat yourself in this period of time.
However, you can still die from hitting the walls.
The bombs will flash when the effect is ending.
